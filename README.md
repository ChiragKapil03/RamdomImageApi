## Project Overview

This project provides a **Random Image API** that returns a random image from a list of image URLs every time a request is made to the `/api/image/random` route. The images are sourced from publicly available URLs, and the API uses the Express.js framework to handle HTTP requests.

The main goal of this project is to create a simple backend service in Node.js that can be easily integrated into front-end applications, websites, or used for educational purposes.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment used to build the backend.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js that helps to handle HTTP requests and route management.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The primary language used to write the backend logic.
- **npm**: Node.js package manager to install dependencies.
